# Blazor Server
This is an introductory overview of Blazor Server. 
This project covers how Blazor Server looks, runs and its most important features such as SignalR. 
Eventually, I will compare Blazor Server to ASP.NET Core's other four project types. 

# Short Description
Blazor Server is similar to Blazor Client with the rich interactivity and having no lag time.
However, via the SignalR connection, you're using C# and still running on the server.
Since some work is done on the client and some work is done on the server, Blazor Server is an ideal project for most cases 
because you're getting the best of both worlds.
